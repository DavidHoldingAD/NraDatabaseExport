# NapDatabaseExport
This is a simple project aimed to fulfil the requirements for regulation N-18 in Bulgaria.

This regulation requires every software that manages sales which are paid in cash to supply an open source tool to extract information from the database.

This tool lets you:

1. Connect to a local database or a server.
2. List all databases on that server.
3. List all tables in the database.
4. Select which tables to extract information from.
5. Choose a file format for extraction.
6. Save all the data from each selected table in a separate file.
